A good writer is a lazy writer ( or was it Mathematician? Well anyway.)  , so I will leave the introduction of VICE to ChatGPT:

"VICE is a media company that was founded in 1994 as a print magazine in Montreal, Canada. It has since grown into a multi-platform media company that produces documentaries, news, and cultural content.

VICE's documentaries often focus on controversial and taboo topics, including drug use, crime, and social justice issues. The company has a reputation for producing investigative and immersive content that gives a voice to underrepresented communities and sheds light on important issues.

Over the years, VICE has produced a number of highly acclaimed documentaries, including "The Vice Guide to North Korea," "The Vice Guide to Liberia," and "The Vice Guide to Everything." The company has also won numerous awards for its documentary work, including Emmys and Peabodys.

In addition to its documentary work, VICE also produces news and cultural content for its website, YouTube channel, and television networks. The company has a strong presence on social media and has a large following on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.

Overall, VICE is known for producing provocative and thought-provoking content that pushes boundaries and challenges the status quo. "

In this blog, I want to dive deeper into a self-selected subset of my most influential documentaries. Influential because I gained important insights from them during a difficult time. Skills like relativization and discovering that there are incredibly interesting topics out there in the world. If you don't keep discovering niche information, your world gets smaller instead. Where the biggest contributer to this, is the fact that having a limited scope of interesting things causes less to seem dull. Which sounds contradictory, but I suggest that the ability to find ordinary things dull greatly increases ones curiousity.

## Shane Smith


To begin with, I would like to introduce you to Shane Smith. Shane is one of the founders of Vice and I won't write much about his personality. Because I want the reader to experience the rawness of the documentary without bias.

## Hamilton Morris
Hamilton Morris is, in my opinion, the best drug reporter. While most reports are biased, Hamilton uses a more scientific format. All of his scenes are full of sarcasm and irony while having a realistic shade. This is all evident in the first season of his show; Hamilton's Pharmacopoeia, which Hamilton produced for Vice in 2012.

[Hamilton's Pharmacopeia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Yd7M3JNlw&list=PLDbSvEZka6GGo4gH2zxpvvkBGzoo9DAWU)

You can watch season 2 of his series by buying it from Vice or obtaining it somewhere illegally, which I dont renounce.

## Thomas morton
I would like to continue with a suggestion, without spoiling anything: Watch Thomas Morton's Vice reports. And start with:

[Heroin Holiday in the Czech Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYZj9vmfi0&list=PLn5TAMj1xInHU9xkBXTxsvWIQYD8L6p0e&index=11)

Thomas Morton is extremely funny and completely fearless. And most will be hooked.


## Fringes

The Vice docu-series Fringes features different reporters dealing with all kinds of situations. Start laughing with

[Getting Drunk on God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zj7OJjMcnM&list=PLDbSvEZka6GEF5kRloeUpkMa5EOkqDcat&index=13)

[Be shocked by  Uganda's Moonshine Epidemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL3UHF5SlEU&list=PLDbSvEZka6GEF5kRloeUpkMa5EOkqDcat&index=33)

And much more. Just look op "Vice Fringes" on any video platform.
