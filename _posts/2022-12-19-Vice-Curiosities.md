A good writer is a lazy writer ( or was it Mathematician? Well anyway)  , so I will leave the introduction of VICE to ChatGPT:

_ "VICE is a media company that produces documentaries, news, and cultural content, often focusing on controversial and taboo topics. The company is known for its investigative and immersive reporting and has produced a number of highly acclaimed documentaries, winning numerous awards including Emmys and Peabodys. In addition to its documentary work, VICE produces content for its website, YouTube channel, and television networks and has a strong presence on social media. The company is known for its provocative and thought-provoking content that challenges the status quo. "_

In this blog, I want to dive deeper into a self-selected subset of my most influential documentaries. Influential because I gained important insights from them during a difficult time. Skills like relativization and discovering that there are incredibly interesting topics out there in the world. If you don't keep discovering niche information, your world gets smaller instead. Where the biggest contributer to this, is the fact that having a limited scope of interesting things causes less to seem dull. Which sounds contradictory, but I suggest that the ability to find ordinary things dull greatly increases ones curiousity.

## Shane Smith

Shane Smith is a Canadian journalist and media executive who is best known as the co-founder and former CEO of VICE Media. Smith founded VICE as a punk magazine in 1994, and it has since grown into a multi-platform media company that produces documentaries, news, and cultural content.

Smith is known for his bold and provocative reporting style, and he has produced a number of highly acclaimed documentaries for VICE. He has won numerous awards for his journalism and has been recognized for his ability to shed light on important issues and give a voice to underrepresented communities.
To begin with, I would like to introduce you to Shane Smith. Shane is one of the founders of Vice and I won't write much about his personality. Because I want the reader to experience the rawness of the documentary without bias.

## Hamilton Morris
Hamilton Morris is a journalist and researcher known for his work on VICE Media which explores the history and chemistry of psychoactive drugs. He is the son of Dr. John Morris, a renowned neuroscientist and psychopharmacologist who has made significant contributions to the field of drug research.

Hamilton Morris has followed in his father's footsteps, using his knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology to inform his reporting and documentary work.  Morris has written extensively about drug culture and the science behind psychoactive substances.
Both Morris and his father are known for their expertise in the field of drug research and their ability to shed light on important issues related to substance use and abuse. Together, they have made significant contributions to the understanding of drugs and their effects on the human body.

Hamilton Morris is, in my opinion, the best drug reporter. While most reports are biased, Morris, while still being himself, applies a more scientific view. This view is divergent from the main stream, which is why I am attracted to it. All of his scenes are full of sarcasm and irony while having a realistic shade. This is all evident in the first season of his show; Hamilton's Pharmacopoeia, which Hamilton produced for Vice in 2012.

You can watch season 2 of his series by buying it from Vice or obtaining it somewhere illegally, which I dont renounce.
